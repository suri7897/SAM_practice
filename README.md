# Sharpness Awareness Minimization(SAM)

> [!IMPORTANT]
I acknowledge that all ideas and codes presented here are derived from the study titled '**[Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Efficiently Improving Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01412)**' (2020). 
---

This repository contains the implementation of **Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Efficiently Improving Generalization (2020)** by Pierre Foret et al. 
Also, this repository contains the pytorch-code implementation of SAM implementation by [David Samuel](https://github.com/davda54).

For further details on original paper and codes, refer to the repository available at

Paper : https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01412

## **Experiment**

  In `example` folder, you can do simple implementations of Wide-ResNet and Simple CNN models that can be trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM).
  For more information, refer to `README.md` file in `example` folder.

## **Explanation**

For your information, a presentation file titled **`SAM_explain(kor).pdf`** is included in this repository.  
It provides an overview of **SAM** and this experiment, and is written in **Korean**.
